## Latest Changes
### :rocket: New Features
* OpenSCENARIO support:
    - Added support for position with Lane information  (roadId and laneId)
    - Added support for TimeOfDay tag

## CARLA ScenarioRunner 0.9.8
### :rocket: New Features

* OpenSCENARIO support:
    - Added initial support for Catalogs (Vehicle, Pedestrian, Environment, Maneuver, and and MiscObject types only)
### :bug: Bug Fixes
* Fixed #471: Handling of weather parameter (cloudyness -> cloudiness adaption)
* Fixed #472: Spawning issue of pedestrians in OpenSCENARIO
* Fixed #374: Usage of evaluation critieria with multiple ego vehicles in OpenSCENARIO

* Fixed wrong StandStill behavior which return SUCCESS immediatly on a standing actor
* Fixed scenario bug causing junction related scenarios (4, 7, 8 and 9) to not spawn due to lane changes.
### :ghost: Maintenance

* Added timeout for CARLA tick() calls to avoid blocking CARLA server calls

### :rocket: New Features
* Challenge routes can be directly executed with the ScenarioRunner using the --route option
* Agents can be used with the ScenarioRunner (currently only for route-based scenarios)
* New scenarios:
    - Added example scenario for lane change
    - Added cut-in example scenario

    - Added new OutsideRouteLanesTest atomic criter that encompasses both SidewalkTest and WrongLaneTest, returning
      the percentage of route that has been traveled outside the lane.
    - InRouteTest is now more forgiving. The max distance has been increased, but staying above the previous one will eventually 
      also cause failure
    - Changed SidewalkTest atomic criteria to also track other type of out of lane conditions
    - SidewalkTest and WrongLaneTest atomic criterias now track the amount of meters traversed
    - CollisionTest atomic criteria now correctly ignores multiple micro-collisions with the same object

    - Added get_transform() method for CarlaDataProvider
    - Added support for weather conditions
    - Added basic version check to ensure usage of correct CARLA version
    - WaypointFollower atomic can handle pedestrians

    - Added init speed behavior for vehicles
    - Added support for relative velocities
    - Extended convert_position_to_transform with RelativeWorld, RelativeObject and RelativeLane osc_positions
    - Added new trigger atomics InTriggerDistanceToOSCPosition and InTimeToArrivalToOSCPosition to support relative osc_positions

    - Updated implementation to be closer to upcoming OpenSCENARIO standard
    - AfterTermination, AtStart conditions are supported
    - Added initial support for lateral action: LaneChange
    - Added initial support for OSCGlobalAction to set state of traffic signal
    - FollowRoute action is supported for vehicles and pedestrians, for global world positions.
    - Added support for RoadCondition: Friction
    - Redundant rolename object property is no longer required
    - Added support for global parameters
    - Fixed coordinate system to use right-hand as default. Left-hand CARLA system can be used by adding "CARLA:" at the start of the description in the FileHeader.
    - Added support to change actor color
    - Added support for a default actor model, in case the stated model is not available
    - Added support for MiscObjects (besides vehicles and pedestrians)
    - Reworked traffic signal handling: The name has to start now either with "id=" or "pos=" depending on whether the position or id is used as unique identifier
    - Actor physics can now be set via Object Properties (<Property name="physics" value="off" />)
