## Latest changes

* Added NHTSA Traffic Scenarios
    - VehicleTurningRightAtSignal: hero vehicle must react to a vehicle turning right onto it's lane at junction
* Reworked scenario execution
    - Every scenario has to have a configuration provided as XML file.
      Currently there is one XML file for each scenario class
    - The scenario runner is now responsible for spawning/destroying all actors.
    - Renamed vehicle -> actor
    - If all scenarios in one coniguration file should be executed, the scenario_runner can be started with --scenario group:<CONFIG_FILE>
    - Generalized ControlLoss and FollowLeadingVehicle scenarios
    - Added randomization option to scenario_runner and scenarios
* Added new atomic behaviors using py_trees behavior tree library
    - BasicAgentBehavior: drive to target location using CARLA's BasicAgent
    - StandStill: check if a vehicle stands still
    - InTriggerDistanceToNextIntersection: check if a vehicle is within certain distance with respect to the next intersection
    - HandBrakeVehicle: set handbrake to a vehicle
    - TurnVehicle: executes a left or right turn at a junction

## CARLA Scenario_Runner 0.9.2

* Added Traffic Scenarios engine to reproduce complex traffic situations for training and evaluating driving agents
* Added NHTSA Traffic Scenarios
