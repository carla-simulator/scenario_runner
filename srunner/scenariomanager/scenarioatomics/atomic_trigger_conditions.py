"""
This module provides all atomic scenario behaviors that reflect
trigger conditions to either activate another behavior, or to stop
another behavior.

For example, such a condition could be "InTriggerRegion", which checks
that a given actor reached a certain region on the map, and then starts/stops
a behavior of this actor.

The atomics are implemented with py_trees and make use of the AtomicBehavior
base class
